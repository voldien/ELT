OpenGL-Engine
Ever since the ending of my second year in secondary school I've been working with A Engine. Written In C++, with OpenGL as my rendering interface. I started off as a very new beginner in C++/C and knew almost nothing about it's syntax or memory management and etc. . only skill I had was C# and I had written a Extension for Unity 3D , XNA & created first version of Marshmallows Invasion(Still in progress of second Version), and few another small project.

I'm going to document about the process here on IndieDB. because it's a part of my assignment in School.anyway let's get to the good stuff.
